# MobilityHub: Intelligent proximity-based medical services recommender utilizing Native CoreLocations Framework and Natural Language Processing

This app allows the user to search for a type of healthcare service or a specific address using keyboard input or voice input. After the user presses the search button, my app uses backend calls to determine the nearest medical services and locations relevant to the user’s query, and displays the results sorted by their distance from the user’s current location. The user is then able to see all of the results as keypoints relative to their location on the map view, and as they select each result destination from the table view, my app displays the route to that location as well as basic information such as the street address of that destination and the distance.
